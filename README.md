# JavaScript Challenge #2

This assignment is quite a bit more difficult than the first. It's an adaption of a JavaScript challenge I was given as part of a job interview. I was directed to visit a page that looked exactly like `index.html` and given no further instructions.

Because I'm nice — and because this isn't a job interview — I'll give you a hint: there's nothing wrong with `index.html`. What you're looking at *is* the challenge. It's a two-part test:
 1. Figure out the instructions.
 2. Complete the instructions.

Some other notes:
 - You may use JavaScript or jQuery — it's possible to solve the challenge using either.
 - The **only** file you need to alter is `js/challenge.js`.
 - **This is a challenge for you — not for your classmates, and not for your mentor.** If you are struggling, reach out to Shereen or me. It's important that Shereen and I understand what we need to focus on, and it's much easier to gather that information if you are proactive and engage us.

## How to get started
 - Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
 - Click on the green `Clone or download` link **on your forked copy** and copy the `Clone with SSH` link. It should look like `git@github.com:your-username/re-coded-js-02.git`
 - The next few commands are all run in Terminal (or in the IDE's terminal):
    * Type `cd ~/code/` to change into your `code/` directory
    * Type `git clone git@github.com:your-username/re-coded-js-02.git` to clone the remote repository down to your local machine.
    * Type `cd re-coded-js-02/` to change into the newly-cloned directory.
    * Type `subl .` to open the current directory (`.`, which is the `re-coded-js-02/` directory) in Sublime Text. If you are still using the IDE, either manually navigate to the cloned directory in the File Tree or try typing `atom .` instead of `subl .`
 - Code your solution in `js/challenge.js`, and keep `index.html` open in Chrome. You can simply refresh the page in Chrome to test out the changes you make in `js/challenge.js`. Remember to keep the Chrome JS console open to watch out for JS errors!

## When you are finished
 - Add, commit, and push all of your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
 - Submit a Pull Request against my repository.

## Good luck, and have fun!
